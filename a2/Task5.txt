The 12 BLEU scores are reported below, using the MLE language model.

If you compare the reference translations, it is noticable that Google/Watson
use much more puntuation and abbreviations than the Hansard. This is likely because
the Hansard is an official document where the scribes reluctantly use short forms.
The English Hansard uses periods where there weren't any in French, showing that
it was up to interpretation wthether or not the speaker's sentence was actually finished
or not. Google/Watson use more direct translation and have less ability to understand
an idiom in either language. For example, Google/Watson translate 'la coeur du debat'
as 'the heart of the debate', which is a very literal translation, but isn't as common
in English. Another example is where the English Hansard is able to pick up 'deep cuts
to the budget', but Google/Watson both can't translate it to anything meaningful in english.

Using fewer references means that n-gram precisions will be lower. This is likely worse,
since it lends to the idea that there is only one correct answer for a translation. For
example, when looking at line 12, the three references use 3 different synonyms (stop,
end and terminate). While these all have the same meaning, using fewer references means
that we are discounting our n-gram precisions and overall accuracy because the candidate
didn't include the exact same synonym as the reference, which isn't a meaningful reason.
All three of these synonyms should all be deemed correct, so having fewer than 3 references
is bad because they don't capture the variance of possible correct translations.

The results of the translations show that having a larger alignment model helps to produce
more uncommon words in the translations, rather than translating to a more common english
word that is only slightly related in meaning. This helps to improve BLEU scores. However,
many trigram precisions force the BLEU score to zero, regardless of the alignment model.
This is because our language model was built using a very strong markov assumption, with
only bigram and unigram counts to get an MLE estimate. This means that our language model
doesn't have enough context in general to produce accuracte tri-gram orderings.
