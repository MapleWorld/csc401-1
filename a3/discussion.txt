Part 4

In general, part 4.2 seems to be more accurate, which makes sense considering it starts with the correct
answer, and since the IBM Watson products are usually sophisticated enough that they have a low error rate
in each direction of the text->speech->text conversion. Watson seems to be able to recognize its own synthesized
speech better than our training set, as it is probably trained extensively on the small number of voices
it offers. You can see this in utterance 2, where Watson can recognize cartoon from its own synthesized speech,
but misinterprets it from ours. This could also be because the training set we use has speakers with more unusual
accents, compared with the Michael and Lisa voices with are pretty standard.

Looking at utterance 7, we get more deletion errors in Part 4.1 then 4.2, as short words like 'the' may be
spoken very quickly by a natural speaker, but are likely enunciated more clearly in the synthesized speech.
In utterance 13, there are two deletion errors in Part 4.1, making me think that the Watson Speech to Text
service may just ignore words when it can't make a reasonable guess.

Another interesting case is utterance 25, where both hypotheses mess up 'dont', even though both were correct
for the same reference text in utterance 24. This shows two problems. One is that the TTS engine struggles with
contractions when the apostrophe is removed. It also shows that the interpretation by Watson of certain words
depends heavily on the voice used, as it could recognizeit from a Male voice, but not a Female.

Another issue occurs in utterane 15, where the difference between tug boat and tugboat gets marked as an error,
although it is ambiguous which one is actually correct, and using a more sophisticated error may help reduce false
positive error counts like these.
