Below are the results from three classifiers from Part 4, using the IBM Watson classifier.
The test set is grouped by query, and the accuracy is computed per group.

Keeping in mind that the baseline for the three classifiers was around 70% accuracy,
there are a number of groups that are significantly above or below that accuracy level.
However, many of these groups have a small number of samples, and are less statistically
significant.  If we only consider groups with 7 or more samples, and accuracies that are greater
than 80% or less than 60%, we can draw some interesting conclusions, for the model with N = 5000.

Group: obama                     Accuracy: 1.0                  Number of samples:  10   Number of class 0:   1   Number of class 4:   9
Group: exam                      Accuracy: 1.0                  Number of samples:   7   Number of class 0:   5   Number of class 4:   2
Group: g2                        Accuracy: 1.0                  Number of samples:   7   Number of class 0:   0   Number of class 4:   7
Group: nike                      Accuracy: 0.6                  Number of samples:  15   Number of class 0:   4   Number of class 4:  11
Group: "night at the museum"     Accuracy: 0.6                  Number of samples:  15   Number of class 0:   3   Number of class 4:  12
Group: safeway                   Accuracy: 0.571428571429       Number of samples:   7   Number of class 0:   5   Number of class 4:   2

Group: gm                        Accuracy: 0.5                  Number of samples:  16   Number of class 0:  16   Number of class 4:   0
Group: Malcolm Gladwell          Accuracy: 0.5                  Number of samples:  10   Number of class 0:   3   Number of class 4:   7
Group: at&t                      Accuracy: 0.461538461538       Number of samples:  13   Number of class 0:  13   Number of class 4:   0
Group: aig                       Accuracy: 0.142857142857       Number of samples:   7   Number of class 0:   7   Number of class 4:   0

So we are extremely accurate at predicting tweets with obama, exams and g2.  These are topics that people are typically extremely
emotional and passionate about.  This dataset is from 2009, when Barack Obama became President, and this topic was the subject of
much debate worldwide.  The usage of the word exam is typically either a very negative tweet about having to prepare for exams coming
up, or a celebratory tweet about having just finished an exam.  The word G2 is significant in Ontario, where it represents the driver's
license class where one can finally drive on their own, and passing this test is a big achievement in a teenager's life.  I think that
these three topics are easily predictable by the classifier because they typically involve much stronger sentiment than a regular tweet.

The accuracy for predicting tweets involving companies, like General Motors, AT&T and AIG, is significantly below the baseline.  For these
tweets, there was a major class imbalance, where all of the test samples were in class 0.  To combat this, we compute precision, recall
and the F1 score for obama, exam, g2, gm, at&t and aig.

         Precision          Recall          F1 score
obama    1                  1               1
exam     1                  1               1
g2       1                  1               1
gm       0                  0               0
at&t     0                  0               0
aig      0                  0               0

The F1 score shows how much more accurate the classifier is for the first three compared to the second three, and also shows how the accuracy
isn't really a valid metric when all samples in a group are part of the negative class.

We can, however, re-label the data, and pretend class 0 is positive and class 4 is negative.  After re-labelling, we get the following:

         Precision          Recall          F1 score
obama    1                  1               1
exam     1                  1               1
g2       1                  1               1
gm       1                  0.5             0.6667  
at&t     1                  0.4615          0.6316  
aig      1                  0.1429          0.25

After re-labelling, we can see that GM and AT&T were predicted fairly well, while AIG was predicted poorly.
